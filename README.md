# Vectorscript help

Vectorscript is the Pascal-like internal programming language for the
VectorWorks CAD package.

Set the shell variable **TM_VSCRIPT_MANUAL** to point to the
"Pages" directory of your VectorScript Function Reference to enable the
"Lookup" command (usually this directory is "/Applications/VectorWorks
12.0.0/VWHelp/VectorScript Reference/Pages").
